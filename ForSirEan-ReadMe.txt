Good day Sir.

In this repository, the following are the group members for CS3105:

Amiel Joseph Lozada - talovakhin
Isaiah Mari Quinicot - TheMixedCoffee
Marc Lloyd Quisel - marqueesel

Note:
Amiel Lozada was able to contribute by committing the side nav bar.
However, he passed the file to Marc Quisel through G-drive since Amiel
was having internet issues. 

Allan Jericho Bargamento (Design Project groupmate) is not a student
from this class but he contributed in making the static web page,
but he did not do anything related to Vue.js or node.js

The system is very much incomplete and we apologize for taking too long
in finishing the website. However, we will still continue to update this
